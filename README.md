# IV Supply Calculator

The Supplies calculator is a web-based tool that calculates the required supplies for IV medications based on user input. This is primarily geared towards NEW orders, not refills.

## Calculations

The IV Supply Calculator performs the following calculations:

- IV Tubing: 1 tubing per day per IV
- Saline Flushes: 20ml per infusion, based on the dosing frequency and the number of days
- Heparin (if ordered): 5ml per infusion, based on the dosing frequency and the number of days
- IV Dressing Change Kits: 1 kit per 7 days, rounded up
- Red/Blue Caps: 1 cap per infusion, based on the dosing frequency and the number of days

## Dependencies

The IV Supply Calculator does not have any external dependencies. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be run in any modern web browser.
